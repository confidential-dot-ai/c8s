# volumed teardown — run as a privileged pre-delete hook on every volumed node.
#
# Removes the device-mapper stack volumed opened for the pods on this node:
# unmount each c8s volume, then close the dm-verity and dm-crypt mappings
# behind it. The mappings keep the backing disk open, so a volume they cover
# cannot be reopened while they are there. Anything this hook cannot close is
# swept by volumed the next time it starts.
# Idempotent: a node with nothing open exits clean. A mapping that will not
# close exits non-zero — the alternative is an uninstall that reports success
# and leaves state no later run can reach.
#
# Names come from internal/cmds/volumed/open.go (mapperName): the mappings are
# c8s-crypt-<pod-uid>-<volume> and c8s-verity-<pod-uid>-<volume>, and the
# verity device is the mount source.
