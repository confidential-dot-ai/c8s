		Short: "Fetch this pod's secrets from CDS and write them into the pod",
		Long: `get-secret fetches the secrets a workload is granted and writes each one
to a file for the pod's other containers to read.

It authenticates with the pod's CDS-issued certificate and a sandbox token
redeemed from the node's admission inventory, and CDS releases only when the
containers running in the sandbox match a workload entry holding a grant for
the requested path. That is only true once every main container is running, so
early attempts are refused and get-secret retries — the files appear shortly
after the workload starts, and a consumer must wait for them.

A path the store does not hold yet is created, so the first pod of a workload
to ask is the one that defines the value. The value is generated inside CDS and
does not survive a CDS restart; nothing durable may be keyed on it.`,
