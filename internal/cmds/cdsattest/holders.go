// admit names the client a full store takes an entry from so that want may
// have one, and reports whether such a client exists.
//
// The share every holder is entitled to is the capacity divided between the
// holders and want, floored at minShare. Both halves of that matter:
//
//   - Counting want in the denominator means a client holding nothing is
//     always admitted. If no holder were above capacity/(holders+1) the total
//     would be under capacity, so the store would not be full.
//   - The floor is what an attacker cannot buy down. Without it the share is
//     capacity divided by a number of clients the attacker creates, so paying
//     for addresses drives every honest client's floor toward one entry.
//
// A holder at or below its share is never taken from, so the request that
// found the store full is refused instead once every holder is at the floor.
