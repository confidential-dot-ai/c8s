		Short: "Fetch this pod's volume keys from CDS and have the node open them",
		Long: `get-volume fetches the key for each encrypted volume a workload is granted
and hands it to the node agent, which opens the device and mounts it read-only
into this pod.

It authenticates with the pod's CDS-issued certificate and a sandbox token
redeemed from the node's admission inventory, and CDS releases only when the
containers running in the sandbox match a workload entry holding a grant for
the requested path. That is only true once every main container is running, so
early attempts are refused and get-volume retries — the volume appears shortly
after the workload starts, and a consumer must wait for it.

The key must already be in the store, put there by ` + "`c8s volume create`" + `.
Nothing here creates one.`,
