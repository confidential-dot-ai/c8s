		Short: "Build encrypted volumes and store their keys in CDS",
		Long: `Build a volume that only an attested workload can open.

'create' packages a directory into an encrypted, integrity-protected image and
puts its key into the CDS secret store — or, with --mutable, builds a writable
volume the workload can both read and write, without integrity protection. The
image is ciphertext either way: copy it to the node by any means, including
through the untrusted host.

'attach' then presents that image to the node as a disk carrying the serial the
volume is found by, and 'detach' removes it. Both run on the node, as root, and
are only needed where the hypervisor cannot hand you a disk with a serial of
your choosing.

The key is released to a pod when the images running in that pod's sandbox match
an allowlist entry whose 'secrets' grant covers the key's path. 'create' prints
the grant and the pod annotations to apply; it does not modify any workload.

Writes are signed with an operator EC private key you supply via --operator-key
(or C8S_OPERATOR_KEY), whose public half CDS pins via 'c8s install
--operator-keys'.

Keys live in the CDS process and nowhere else, so a CDS restart makes every
volume in the cluster unopenable until its key is written again. Keep the escrow
file 'create' writes.`,
