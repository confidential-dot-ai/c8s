# Module signing

The guest kernel loads exactly two out-of-tree modules — `nvidia.ko` and
`nvidia-uvm.ko` — and `CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_KERNEL_FORCE_CONFIDENTIALITY`
refuses to load them unsigned. That is the only reason signing exists here.

Integrity does **not** rest on these signatures (GPU-IMAGE-PLAN.md D4): the
module bytes live in the dm-verity-measured rootfs, and the boot sequence
latches `kernel.modules_disabled=1` once they are loaded. The signature is
lockdown plumbing.

## How it is split

The mechanism — which flags carry what, and why `CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL`
stays off — is documented once in confos's
[`docs/module-signing.md`](https://github.com/confidential-dot-ai/confidential-os-builder/blob/main/docs/module-signing.md).
What is specific to this image:

- **`node-guest-image/module-signing.crt`** — the public certificate, ours,
  committed here. `node-guest-image/build` passes it to confos as
  `--module-signing-cert` and to `confos-fetch-gpu` as `MODULE_SIG_CERT`.
  It is measured, so rotating it changes the image measurement.
- **The private key** is a CI secret (`MODULE_SIG_KEY_PEM`), never committed.

Owning the certificate here is the point: which key may sign modules that
load in this image is an image decision, not a builder decision (#264).

## Generating the keypair

Run once; keep the private key in a password manager or KMS as well as the CI
secret, because losing it means re-issuing the certificate and rolling the
measurement.

```sh
cat > /tmp/x509.genkey <<'EOF'
[ req ]
default_bits = 4096
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
prompt = no
string_mask = utf8only
x509_extensions = myexts

[ req_distinguished_name ]
O = <your org>
CN = confos guest module signing
emailAddress = <owner>

[ myexts ]
basicConstraints = critical,CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid
EOF

openssl req -new -nodes -utf8 -sha512 -days 36500 -batch -x509 \
  -config /tmp/x509.genkey -outform PEM \
  -out node-guest-image/module-signing.crt \
  -keyout /tmp/module-signing.key
```

Then:

1. Commit `node-guest-image/module-signing.crt` (public — safe to publish).
2. Store the **key + certificate concatenated** as one PEM in the GitHub
   Actions secret `MODULE_SIG_KEY_PEM` on this repo, for `c8s-image.yml`:
   ```sh
   cat /tmp/module-signing.key node-guest-image/module-signing.crt   # -> paste as the secret
   ```
3. Shred `/tmp/module-signing.key` and `/tmp/x509.genkey`.

`-days 36500` avoids an expiry that would silently stop module loading on a
long-lived image; the certificate is not a revocation-managed PKI.

## Rotation

Rotating the certificate changes the kernel measurement, so it is a reviewed
PR plus an attestation reference-value refresh — the same procedure as any
pin bump. Rotating **only** the private key is not possible: the certificate
carries its public half, so both move together.
