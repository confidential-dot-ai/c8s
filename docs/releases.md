# Releases

c8s is one versioned release unit. A root `vX.Y.Z` tag versions the CLI,
component images, measured node image, Kata guest image, and Helm chart
together. Maintainers do not calculate or push release tags manually.

## Automatic versioning

After every build and retag job in the `Docker` workflow succeeds for a push to
`main`, [`semver-tag.yml`](../.github/workflows/semver-tag.yml) examines the
Conventional Commits since the latest stable release tag.

| Commit | Version change while on `0.x` |
| --- | --- |
| `fix:` | patch |
| `feat:` | minor |
| `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | minor |
| any other type | no release |

Major version zero is deliberate while the public interfaces settle. The
workflow rejects any automatically calculated tag outside the configured `v0`
line. Graduating to `v1.0.0` requires a reviewed change to both the git-cliff
bump policy and the workflow's `RELEASE_MAJOR` gate; a breaking commit alone
cannot cross that boundary.

Pre-release tags are not stable baselines. The first automatic stable release
is therefore `v0.1.0`, following the existing `v0.1.0-rc*` series. After that,
the highest release-worthy change across all unreleased commits wins.

## Publication

Release publication stays inside the successful main-push `Docker` run:

1. The normal main-push image build and retag legs complete successfully.
2. git-cliff calculates the next stable version after all older main-push
   Docker runs finish.
3. Every component image is rebuilt from that exact commit under a
   commit-scoped staging tag. This retains the old tag-triggered path's
   all-components rebuild without starting a second workflow or trusting a
   potentially stale `main` alias. A retry reuses an existing staging digest so
   mutable upstream base images cannot change a partially published release.
4. The Helm chart is linted, rendered, and packaged reproducibly for that
   version in a read-only job.
5. A job protected by the `release` environment verifies every staging digest,
   then creates a create-only annotated Git tag with the built-in
   `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
6. The verified manifests are promoted to `vX.Y.Z`, `X.Y.Z`, the moving `X.Y`
   compatibility tag, `latest` when this is the newest stable release, and the
   commit's short-SHA tag used by the measured Kata build. The same job
   publishes chart `X.Y.Z`. Normal branch builds update `main`, never `latest`.
7. Completion of the original Docker run starts the existing measured node,
   Kata guest, and e2e workflows. The node workflow builds both TDX/SNP formats,
   then promotes their exact commit manifests to
   `rke2-{tdx,snp}[-cdi]-vX.Y.Z` only after every matrix leg succeeds. It does
   not publish a bare `vX.Y.Z` because that would not identify a platform and
   format.
8. The Kata job adds the matching `vX.Y.Z` aliases without rebuilding a second
   time for a tag event. Existing stable node and Kata aliases are verified by
   digest and never silently moved by a retry or manual rebuild.

For the first stable release, the measured node aliases are therefore
`rke2-tdx-v0.1.0`, `rke2-tdx-cdi-v0.1.0`, `rke2-snp-v0.1.0`, and
`rke2-snp-cdi-v0.1.0` in
`ghcr.io/confidential-dot-ai/node-guest-base`. There is deliberately no moving
`v0.1` alias for a measured image; operators pin the exact release whose
measurement they allowlist.

GitHub intentionally does not start new workflows for the tag created with
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. That is part of this design: component and chart publication is
explicit in the originating run, while the existing node/Kata workflows consume
that run's successful `workflow_run` completion. No OAuth App, GitHub App,
personal access token, or long-lived release credential is required.

## One-time GitHub setup

1. Create a GitHub Actions environment named `release`.
2. Set its deployment branches and tags to **Selected branches and tags**, allow
   only the `main` branch, and disable administrator bypass. Do not add a
   required reviewer if releases must remain fully automatic.
3. Ensure organization/repository Actions policy permits the workflow's
   explicit `contents: write` and `packages: write` permissions.
4. If a tag ruleset covers `v*`, ensure it permits GitHub Actions to create a
   new tag. It should continue to reject updates and deletions.

The environment contains no release credential. Its purpose is to gate the
stable component/chart publisher and the stable node-image alias publisher.
Calculation and chart construction run in separate read-only jobs, and neither
publisher checks out or executes repository source.

The Git Data API creates annotated but unsigned tags. A ruleset requiring
cryptographically signed `v*` tags will reject this workflow; adding a dedicated
CI signing identity is a separate release-security change.

## Consistency and recovery

Release calculation is sequential by repository-monotonic workflow run ID. It
does not trust runner clocks. Git and GHCR reads are eventually consistent; a
timeout, network partition, malformed response, or exhausted wait budget fails
closed.

Creating `refs/tags/vX.Y.Z` reserves the version. Registry publication is not a
cross-system transaction, so a failure after tag creation can leave that release
temporarily incomplete. Re-run the failed **Docker** workflow to repair its
component/chart publication, or rerun the downstream **c8s-image** workflow to
repair measured node aliases. Missing aliases are created and matching ones are
verified; neither workflow moves a Git release tag or overwrites an exact image
tag whose digest differs. A pulled existing Helm chart must match the
deterministic package byte-for-byte.

The moving `X.Y` image aliases advance only when the run's Git tag is the latest
stable patch in that series. The global `latest` alias advances only for the
newest stable version across all series. Re-running an older workflow therefore
cannot roll either compatibility alias backward.

- A non-release commit completes without creating a stable tag.
- A failed build creates no tag because release calculation depends on every
  image build/retag leg.
- Never move, delete, or reuse a published stable tag. Fix a bad release with a
  new Conventional Commit and let automation create the next version.
