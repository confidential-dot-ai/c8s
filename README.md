[![CI](https://github.com/confidential-dot-ai/c8s/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/confidential-dot-ai/c8s/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**c8s is confidential Kubernetes.** It runs Kubernetes workloads inside
hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environments, so that the data they process
(model weights, prompts, responses, datasets, credentials) stays encrypted in
memory the entire time it is in the cluster, and that property is
cryptographically provable to a third party over the network.

Encryption at rest and in transit are solved problems. Encryption **in use**
is not: the moment a workload runs, its secrets sit in plaintext memory,
readable by whoever operates the machine underneath it. Confidential computing
closes that gap. Modern CPUs (AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX) can run a virtual
machine whose memory is encrypted with keys held by the hardware, measure
exactly what booted into it, and sign that measurement so a remote party can
verify it. The infrastructure operator, the hypervisor, and the Kubernetes
control plane no longer need to be trusted: they schedule the workload, but
they cannot see inside it.

c8s applies that model to Kubernetes end to end, following five principles at
every layer:

1. **Encrypt the runtime.** Workloads run in hardware-encrypted memory.
2. **Measure the code.** The hardware computes a launch digest over exactly
   what booted.
3. **Bind identity to measurement.** Certificates issue only after the
   measurement verifies.
4. **Verify before connecting.** Peers require attestation-rooted identity
   before any traffic flows.
5. **Secure the egress.** Pod-originated TCP to pod and Service
   destinations is intercepted and wrapped in RA-TLS; TCP to non-pod
   external destinations is neither redirected nor dropped (it leaves the
   node plaintext). Non-TCP and unmeshed inbound fail closed rather than
   flowing in the clear. The exceptions are cluster DNS (UDP/53 to the
   cluster DNS server, the sanctioned name-resolution path) and the in-guest
   attestation service's plain HTTPS to AMD KDS.

c8s is built by [Confidential AI](https://confidential.ai) as the substrate
for private AI: inference, fine-tuning, training, and agents where the
infrastructure operator never sees the data. The platform itself is
workload-agnostic: anything that runs on Kubernetes can run confidentially.

## Features

- **Hardware-attested workload identity.** The Certificate Distribution
  Service (CDS) verifies TEE attestation evidence (AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX) and
  signs workload certificates with a mesh CA whose key never leaves the TEE.
  No verified measurement, no certificate. Issued leaves carry the evidence
  CDS accepted and the pod's sandbox ID, so a relying party can ask *which*
  workload is behind a key, not just whether it is a genuine TEE.

- **RA-TLS mesh.** A transparent L4 proxy wraps traffic between workloads in
  mutual TLS rooted in hardware attestation. Plaintext never crosses the pod
  boundary.

- **Two confidential shapes.** Run the whole node as one confidential VM
  (node-as-CVM), or run every pod as its own confidential VM (pod-as-CVM, via
  Kata Containers). See [Architecture](#architecture).

- **Measured boot end to end.** Node images boot via IGVM with dm-verity;
  confidential pods boot a sealed guest image whose launch digest covers the
  entire in-guest security stack.

- **Container image and command-line allowlisting.** Every container is
  enforced against a CDS-served allowlist with two layers: a floor of image
  digests admitted by digest alone, and named workload entries that
  additionally pin the command line each image may run with — and, in the
  guest, the bind-mount destinations and environment variable names.
  Enforced by an
  NRI plugin on the host under node-as-CVM, and by an in-guest
  `policy-monitor` under pod-as-CVM, where the host cannot tamper with it.

- **Attestation-gated secrets.** CDS releases an application secret only once
  a pod's running containers resolve to a single allowlist entry carrying a
  grant for that path. An injected sidecar writes the values to a
  memory-backed volume every container mounts read-only. Works in both
  shapes: the sidecar redeems its sandbox token from the node's admission
  inventory, or from the in-guest `policy-monitor` under pod-as-CVM.

- **Encrypted volumes.** Data too large to be a secret — model weights, in
  practice — encrypted at rest on host-visible storage (dm-crypt) and opened
  only inside the TEE. Immutable volumes verify every read (erofs, dm-verity);
  mutable volumes are writable ext4. The key travels as a secret
  through the release path above, so possession of the volume implies nothing
  without attestation. On node-as-CVM the `volumed` node agent ships
  disabled — `c8s install --volumes` deploys it; under pod-as-CVM `volumed`
  runs inside each guest, baked into the measured image.

- **Fail-closed admission.** A mutating webhook injects certificate sidecars
  and Kata RuntimeClasses; a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy rejects anything that
  escapes injection. The bootstrap ordering fails closed, never open.

- **Confidential GPUs.** NVIDIA GPU passthrough into confidential pods on
  SEV-SNP and TDX hosts, with GPU CC mode. The attestation service verifies
  NVIDIA GPU and NVSwitch evidence; it is not wired into the c8s certificate
  flow end to end, see [Known gaps](#known-gaps-and-open-items).

- **Verifiable from a browser.** A challenge-response protocol and a
  post-quantum over-encrypted channel let end users verify the cluster with
  no special client, via [c8s-verify](https://github.com/confidential-dot-ai/c8s-verify-js).

- **One-command install.** `c8s install --cvm-mode=<shape>` brings all of this
  to an existing cluster (vanilla Kubernetes or RKE2, including AKS
  confidential node pools, where both SEV-SNP and Intel TDX attest through the
  Azure vTPM).

## Architecture

The most consequential choice in c8s is the unit of trust and attestation.
c8s supports both answers.

### Node-as-CVM

The entire Kubernetes node is one confidential VM. Pods are ordinary
containers inside it. A verifier checks the node's launch digest; everything
on the node is inside that one boundary, including the kubelet. Every pod
shares that boundary, so **node-as-CVM is single-tenant**: it isolates the
node from the host, not workloads from each other. This is the simplest and
densest shape, and the only one available on managed services without nested
virtualization (for example Azure AKS).

### Pod-as-CVM

Each pod is its own confidential VM (via the Kata `kata-qemu-snp` or
`kata-qemu-tdx` runtime). The node is just a launchpad and is fully
adversarial. Every pod carries its own launch digest, so each workload
proves its exact state to a verifier independently, and tenants on the same
node are isolated from each other by hardware memory encryption. The
security services each pod relies on (attestation, mesh, image policy) are
baked into the measured guest image, out of the host's reach.

In short: node-as-CVM is the all-or-nothing model (verify the node once,
trust everything on it, one tenant per node), pod-as-CVM is the
mutual-distrust model (the
platform and the workloads do not trust each other, and each pod attests
independently). The full comparison, including density, latency, and platform
support, is in the
[docs](https://confidential.ai/docs/c8s/concepts/trust-boundaries) and
[docs/install-flows.md](docs/install-flows.md).

## Quickstart

Install c8s onto an existing cluster. The full walkthrough is
[docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md); the hosted version with
provisioning guides is at
[confidential.ai/docs/c8s](https://confidential.ai/docs/c8s/how-to/install).

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (vanilla or RKE2) with platform-admin permissions.
- Nodes with the TEE hardware for your chosen shape: an AMD SEV-SNP or Intel
  TDX host for pod-as-CVM, or SEV-SNP / TDX confidential VMs as nodes for
  node-as-CVM
  (see the [first-cluster tutorial](https://confidential.ai/docs/c8s/tutorials/first-confidential-cluster)).
  Node kernels must be recent enough for the TEE (AMD SEV-SNP ≥ 6.11, Intel TDX
  ≥ 6.16), which also satisfies the Linux ≥ 6.5 `SO_PEERPIDFD` the admission
  inventory relies on — see [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).
- Helm 3, `kubectl`, and `crane` on PATH.
- Go 1.26+ to build the CLI.

### Install

```sh
# Build and install the c8s CLI
git clone https://github.com/confidential-dot-ai/c8s
cd c8s
make install

# Label the node that will run CDS
kubectl label node <cds-node> role=cds

# Generate the operator keypair whose public half authorizes allowlist writes
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out operator.key
openssl ec -in operator.key -pubout -out operator.pub

# Install the platform (node-as-CVM) and point the bundled TLS load balancer
# at your workload
c8s install --cvm-mode=node --hardware-platform=sev-snp --namespace c8s-system \
  --operator-keys operator.pub \
  --workload-ref vllm=vllm/deployment/serving:8000 \
  --upstream vllm
```

`--cvm-mode` is required and has no default — `node`, `gke`, and `aks` are the
node-as-CVM shapes, `pod` is pod-as-CVM. `--hardware-platform` is required the
same way: `sev-snp` or `tdx`. An unstated shape would silently mismatch the
cluster it lands on, so the install refuses to guess.

`--workload-ref` adopts an existing workload as a confidential workload and
resolves its images into the bootstrap allowlist (see
[existing workload adoption](docs/operator.md#existing-workload-adoption)).
If you would rather not trust install-time digest resolution, pass
`--resolve-digests=false` and allowlist the digests yourself — see
[Managing the image allowlist](#managing-the-image-allowlist).

### Opt workloads in

Application teams opt in by annotating their pod templates:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    confidential.ai/cw: api
```

The annotation value (`api` here) is a workload id you choose; the
certificate SAN and the `c8s-<id>` headless Service are derived from it.

The webhook injects `c8s get-cert` as a native sidecar, which fetches an
attestation-bound certificate from CDS and renews it. Certificates land in
`/etc/c8s/certs`.

### Pod-as-CVM

`--cvm-mode=pod` installs the Kata runtime and enforces it: every in-scope workload
pod becomes a confidential VM, and non-Kata pods are rejected at admission. Pin the
kata guest launch digest(s) from `c8s kata measure` — one per pod shape you run —
because an in-guest `get-cert` refuses to reach a CDS no measurement pins, so an
unpinned pod-mode install leaves workloads dead at init:

```sh
c8s install --cvm-mode=pod --hardware-platform=sev-snp --namespace c8s-system \
  --operator-keys operator.pub \
  --measurements <cds-guest-digest>,<workload-guest-digest> \
  --workload-ref vllm=vllm/deployment/serving:8000 \
  --upstream vllm
```

See [docs/kata.md](docs/kata.md) for the runtime details and
[docs/DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md) for a minimal demo flow.

### Production notes

- **Pin measurements.** The chart's RA-TLS handshakes accept any TEE-attested
  peer until you pin `cds.measurements` and `ratlsMesh.measurements` to the
  expected launch digests. Leave them empty only on a trusted network.

- **Pin operator keys.** Pass `--operator-keys` at install time or allowlist
  writes stay disabled. Leaving writes disabled and re-deploying CDS on every
  allowlist change works too, but each restart mints a fresh mesh CA, forcing
  downstream consumers onto a new root of trust. See
  [Managing the allowlist](#managing-the-image-allowlist).

### A note on QEMU

- **Pod-as-CVM needs no host QEMU.** kata-deploy ships the kata-static
  payload, which bundles the TEE-capable QEMU builds that `kata-qemu-snp`
  and `kata-qemu-tdx` use. Do not point Kata at a distro QEMU.

- **Node-as-CVM needs QEMU 10.1 or newer, built with `--enable-igvm`.**
  Booting a measured node image via IGVM requires upstream QEMU's IGVM
  support, which most distributions do not ship. Check for it with
  `qemu-system-x86_64 -object igvm-cfg,help`.

## Verifying a cluster from outside

Anyone can verify that a c8s endpoint really terminates inside attested
hardware, without trusting the operator's word for it.

Browsers cannot inspect TLS certificates mid-handshake, so RA-TLS alone is
not browser-verifiable. The [c8s-verify](https://github.com/confidential-dot-ai/c8s-verify-js)
npm package instead runs a challenge-response protocol: the client
sends a fresh nonce and an X-Wing encapsulation key, the TEE returns a
hardware-signed attestation report binding the complete key exchange in one
round trip, and all further traffic flows over a post-quantum over-encrypted
channel (X-Wing: X25519 + ML-KEM-768) inside the regular TLS
session. A malicious TLS-terminating proxy in front of the real endpoint
cannot forge it. The wire contract is
[PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/confidential-dot-ai/c8s-verify-js/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md).

Operators and CLIs can verify directly: `c8s cds verify` checks a CDS's
attestation and reports the operator keys it pins.

make build

# Build and install the c8s CLI for your host platform, onto PATH
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Mutation-test the changes vs origin/main (BASE=<ref> to override)

make clean
```

## Managing the image allowlist

CDS serves the image-digest allowlist that `nri-image-policy` (host) and
`policy-monitor` (in-guest) enforce on every node. The `c8s allowlist`
command reads and mutates it. By default, tls-lb publishes the complete
`/allowlist` API and verifies CDS's attestation before forwarding requests.
When tls-lb uses the chart default CDS-issued public certificate
(`tlsLb.publicTLS.secretName` is empty, discovery mode `cds`), point the CLI at
the same tls-lb URL used for application traffic; no port-forward is required.

```sh
TLS_LB=https://<tls-lb-host>

# Reads are unauthenticated
c8s allowlist export --url "$TLS_LB" \
  --measurements <tls-lb-launch-digest> > allowlist.json
c8s allowlist diff allowlist.json --url "$TLS_LB" \
  --measurements <tls-lb-launch-digest>

# Writes are signed with the operator key
c8s allowlist add sha256:<digest> registry.example.com/app@sha256:<digest> \
  --url "$TLS_LB" --measurements <tls-lb-launch-digest> \
  --operator-key operator.key
c8s allowlist upload allowlist.json \
  --url "$TLS_LB" --measurements <tls-lb-launch-digest> \
  --operator-key operator.key
```

`--measurements` identifies the trusted build of the endpoint you connected
to. For the default public route, use the tls-lb launch digest; the CLI reads
tls-lb's discovery document and verifies its attestation automatically.
Direct CDS URLs remain supported, in which case pin the CDS launch digest.

An empty set accepts any attested endpoint. Reads run with a warning; anything
that signs with the operator key — every `c8s allowlist` write and
`c8s secrets put`/`explain` — is **refused**, because the credential and its
payload would go to whatever answered. A plaintext `--insecure` dev endpoint is
exempt: it already declares that nothing about it is attested.

Do not point this CLI at tls-lb when `tlsLb.publicTLS.secretName` is set. That
front door uses WebPKI (`public_tls.mode=webpki`), and its public certificate is
not cryptographically bound to the discovery attestation, so the CLI
deliberately refuses it. Use a direct CDS RA-TLS URL and the CDS launch digest;
if CDS is not otherwise routable, use a local port-forward:

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n c8s-system svc/c8s-cds 8443:8443 &
c8s allowlist export --url https://localhost:8443 \
  --measurements <cds-launch-digest>
```

Writes are authorized by an operator EC keypair whose **public** half CDS
pins at install time. Generate one and pin it:

```sh
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out operator.key
openssl ec -in operator.key -pubout -out operator.pub

c8s install --operator-keys operator.pub   # plus your other install flags
```

Installing without `--operator-keys` leaves allowlist writes disabled, and
`c8s install` refuses that on the default path unless you pass `--force` to
acknowledge. Supply the private key to the CLI by flag (`--operator-key`) or
environment (`C8S_OPERATOR_KEY`). Write tokens are short-lived and bound to
the request body, so a captured token cannot be replayed against a different
payload. The private key remains on the operator machine: tls-lb forwards only
the signed request and CDS verifies it against the pinned public key.

Set `tlsLb.allowlist.enabled=false` to remove the built-in public route. A
direct CDS connection, including a local port-forward for debugging, can
still be passed explicitly with `--url`.

Verify CDS's root of trust — its launch measurement and the operator key set it
serves — before exposing public ingress, using your own install inputs (the
operator public-key bundle). The key list is fetched over the attested serving
certificate, so it cannot be substituted in transit
([docs/ratls.md](docs/ratls.md)):

```sh
c8s cds verify https://<cds>:8443 \
  --measurements <launch-digest> \
  --operator-keys operator.pub
```

A swapped key set fails this closed. The check protects the verifier that runs
it, so run it continuously (CI), not only at bootstrap.

Two caveats worth knowing before production: revocation is currently coarse
(remove the key from `cds.operatorKeys` and re-install), and this check protects
only verifiers that run it. For
GitOps consumers, `c8s render-values --operator-keys operator.pub` embeds the
PEM content (the chart value takes content, never a file path); the chart
wiring is described in [docs/operator.md](docs/operator.md).

## Docker images

All images are published to GHCR on pushes to `main`. Release-worthy merges also
receive stable `vX.Y.Z`, `X.Y.Z`, and `X.Y` aliases in that same workflow run.
Per-role image names remain stable, but each image copies the same multi-mode
`c8s` binary and sets an appropriate entrypoint. See
[docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md) for the version policy.

The measured `node-guest-base` artifacts follow the same root release with
platform-qualified exact aliases such as `rke2-tdx-v0.1.0` and
`rke2-snp-cdi-v0.1.0`; they intentionally have no ambiguous bare or moving
SemVer alias.

## Known gaps and open items

c8s is built around a strong threat model, and we would rather list the holes
than let you discover them:

- **Measurements are not pinned by default.** Until `cds.measurements` and
  `ratlsMesh.measurements` are set, the mesh accepts any attested peer. Fine
  for demos, mandatory homework for production.

- **CDS is a singleton.** The mesh CA key lives only in CDS process
  memory; a restart mints a new CA and workloads re-bootstrap.

- **Secrets and volume keys live only in CDS memory.** There is no persistent
  or external key store: a CDS restart destroys every secret and volume key,
  every workload holding one must be rolled, and volume keys come back only
  from the operator's escrow file. Rotation, versioning and delete are absent
  — a replaced value is gone, and pods keep what they read at startup.

- **Mesh peers are verified by CA chain, not per-peer measurement.** Leaves
  carry the evidence CDS verified at issuance, and `VerifyPolicy` has a
  `RequireCAEvidence` mode that re-checks it — measurement included — on every
  connection, but no shipped profile enables it. There are no SPIFFE-style URI
  SANs, and per-workload peer policy is not enforced.

- **A workload's sandbox identity is CA-vouched, not hardware-bound.** The
  sandbox ID in a leaf is signed in by the mesh CA on the word of an on-node
  admission inventory; it is not folded into the TEE report. Any process that
  can bind the node's privileged inventory port can vouch for a sandbox it
  does not run.

- **The image allowlist gates digest and command line, not the rest of the
  pod spec.** Each container's `command` prefix and `args` remainder are
  enforced against the effective argv, and bind-mount destinations and env
  variable names are enforceable in the guest; capabilities and the
  remaining pod-spec fields are not. Nothing enforces which images run
  *together* — every running image must be allowlisted, but no gate requires
  the set in one pod to match a single workload entry.

- **Secrets and encrypted volumes under pod-as-CVM carry weaker guarantees
  than on a node.** Both work — the injected fetchers redeem their sandbox
  token from the in-guest `policy-monitor` over loopback, and `volumed
  --guest` opens devices inside the pod's own CVM — but the sandbox ID a
  release is gated on is a host-written CRI annotation there, not a value the
  kernel read, and the allowlist enforcement it consults is in-guest software
  rather than a host hook. A deployment whose threat model cannot accept
  either should stay on node-as-CVM.

- **Init containers cannot consume a released secret.** The secret volume is
  mounted into every container in the pod, but CDS releases only once *every*
  main container is running — that is when the sandbox matches a whole
  workload entry. An ordinary init container runs to completion before that
  point, so it sees an empty directory, and one that blocks waiting for its
  file deadlocks the pod it gates. Secrets are consumable from main
  containers, which must wait for the file rather than read it at startup. The
  injected fetcher is a native sidecar for this reason: it is the one entry in
  `initContainers` that keeps running alongside the workload.

- **`c8s allowlist` writes reach running confidential pods only under a
  pinned CDS measurement.** In-guest `policy-monitor` refuses to refresh from
  CDS unless the pod's launch-committed init-data document pins the CDS
  launch digest (SNP `HOST_DATA`, TDX `MRCONFIGID`). Installs with no pinned
  measurements, and the chart-managed pods in the release namespace (which
  get no init-data), enforce only the seed baked into the measured guest
  image — admitting a new workload image there means rebuilding it. The
  gating is deliberately fail-closed — "any attested TEE" is not good enough
  here, because the host can boot its own CVM from the same guest image and
  serve an allowlist of its choosing.

- **Encrypted volumes are attached at node boot, and a force-deleted volume
  pod leaks its dm stack.** A volume reaches a node-as-CVM node as a block
  device declared in the VM spec; adding one to a running node is not
  supported (it is a VM spec change and a node reboot). `volumed` tears a
  volume down only when the pod's cgroup empties; a `kubectl delete pod
  --force --grace-period=0` that leaves it populated leaves the
  dm-crypt/dm-verity targets and the mount behind, with the volume key
  resident in kernel memory, until an operator closes them by hand
  (`dmsetup ls | grep ^c8s-`). `volumed` does not reconcile existing
  mappings on start, so restarting it does not recover them. See
  [docs/volumes.md](docs/volumes.md).

- **Root workloads are intercepted but cannot egress to non-mesh peers.**
  In-guest egress exemptions are scoped to the attestation service and the
  mesh proxy by systemd cgroup (a root workload is in no exemption cgroup),
  so TCP from a root tenant is redirected into the mesh (which fails for
  non-mesh destinations) and non-TCP is dropped. Run workloads as non-root
  so legitimate traffic is mesh-routed.

- **Pod-as-CVM picks one CPU TEE per install.** Both SEV-SNP and TDX are
  supported, but `--hardware-platform` selects one for the whole cluster;
  mixed SNP+TDX clusters are not. Pod-as-CVM is also unavailable on Azure,
  which does not expose nested virtualization.

- **GPU attestation is not wired end to end.** GPU passthrough into
  confidential pods works, and both the kata GPU guest and the node CVM fail
  closed on a non-CC GPU.
  [attestation-rs](https://github.com/confidential-dot-ai/attestation-rs)
  verifies NVIDIA GPU and NVSwitch evidence (SPDM via NRAS, nonce-bound to the
  CPU TEE evidence), but c8s does not collect GPU evidence in the guest or
  require it at certificate issuance, so no positive GPU attestation reaches
  the relying party.

- **The browser over-encryption channel does not stream.** Requests and
  responses are buffered per envelope; responses over 32 MiB fail rather than
  stream.

- **Operator key revocation is coarse.** No CRL/OCSP; revoking an operator
  key means removing it and re-installing.

## Roadmap

The direction of travel:

- **GPU attestation end to end.** Collect GPU evidence in the guest and
  require it at certificate issuance, so a positive GPU attestation reaches
  the relying party rather than stopping at the attestation service.

- **In-TEE volume encryption.** Stream plaintext into a CVM that generates the
  key, writes the encrypted volume, and commits the key straight to the secret
  store, so the party supplying the data never holds the key that opens it.
  `c8s volume create` encrypts on the operator's machine, which means the key
  is generated outside the TEE and escrowed to a local file.

- **IGVM support for Kata.** Move the per-pod runtime's measured boot to
  IGVM, unifying pod-as-CVM and node-as-CVM on one measured-boot format.

- **Encrypted RDMA.** Encrypted GPU-to-GPU and node-to-node RDMA for
  confidential multi-node training and inference.

## Standing on the shoulders of the community

c8s exists because a lot of excellent open work came before it, and we want
to be loud about that:

- [Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) is
  the foundation of our pod-as-CVM shape: the runtime, kata-deploy, and the
  guest tooling are outstanding engineering, and the maintainers have built
  something genuinely rare: VMs with the operational feel of containers.

- [Confidential Containers](https://github.com/confidential-containers)
  pioneered the confidential pod model that c8s builds on, including the
  guest-pull design that keeps container images out of the host's hands.

- The [Confidential Computing Consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io/)
  and the wider ecosystem (the AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX stacks, the IGVM
  format, OVMF, and the NVIDIA confidential computing work) provide the
  hardware and firmware bedrock all of this stands on.

Where we fix or extend something upstream, we aim to contribute it back.
