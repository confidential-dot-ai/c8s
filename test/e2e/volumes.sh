# Live-cluster check of the encrypted-volume flow (docs/volumes.md) end to end:
# operator-written key blobs, workload entries with argv policy and a secrets
# grant, and a busybox consumer per volume mode serving its plaintext over HTTP.
#
# Sequence:
#   1. PUT both pre-built volume key blobs into the CDS secret store
#      (two-phase flow: the lane built the images with `c8s volume create
#      --dry-run` before boot, because volume devices must be attached at VM
#      creation — there is no disk hotplug on the metal node kernels).
#   2. Allowlist the reader busybox invocation as a WORKLOAD entry (digest +
#      exact argv + secrets grant), run it, and curl its served secret back out
#      of the immutable volume.
#   3. Prove argv enforcement: the same image with a different argv is denied.
#   4. Allowlist the writer invocation, run it, and curl its served file out of
#      the mutable volume; delete and recreate the pod and read it again to
#      prove the write reached the ciphertext device, not a pod-local fs.
#
# Needs kubectl pointed at a cluster with c8s installed with --volumes, `c8s`
# and `crane` on PATH, the volume devices already attached to E2E_VOL_NODE
# (serials c8s-vol-<name>), and:
#   C8S_MEASUREMENTS    launch measurement pinning the CDS endpoint
#   C8S_OPERATOR_KEY    path to the operator EC key PEM pinned on CDS
#   E2E_VOL_NODE        node name the volume devices are attached to
#   E2E_VOL_IMM_ESCROW  escrow (key blob) file of the pre-built immutable volume
#   E2E_VOL_MUT_ESCROW  escrow file of the pre-built mutable volume
#   E2E_VOL_IMM_CONTENT exact bytes the immutable volume's secret.txt must serve
# Optional:
#   E2E_BUSYBOX         image ref for the consumers (default busybox:1.36 —
#                       1.38 is in the node image's baked floor, so it would
#                       not exercise the entries)
#   E2E_VOL_IMM_NAME / E2E_VOL_MUT_NAME   volume names (default imm / mut)
#   E2E_VOL_MUT_MARKER  bytes the writer writes; a single shell word, no quotes
#                       (default: c8s-e2e-mut-proof)
#   E2E_CDS_LOCAL_PORT  local port for the CDS port-forward (default 18443)
#   E2E_MESH_CA         path to a pinned mesh CA bundle (default: read from the
#                       tls-lb pod, which serves the live CA on its cert volume)
