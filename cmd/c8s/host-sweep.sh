# c8s host sweep — run by `c8s uninstall` as a privileged init container on
# every linux node (a short-lived kubectl-applied DaemonSet; see
# cmd/c8s/uninstall.go).
#
# `helm uninstall` already drives the supported cleanup: the chart's
# pre-delete hooks remove the NRI plugin and volumed mappings, and the mesh's
# preStop strips its traffic interception. Every one of those is best-effort:
# hooks need a release healthy enough to run them, a preStop is bounded by
# the pod's termination grace period (and the runtime restart it triggers can
# kill the pod mid-cleanup), the mesh preStop deliberately keeps its
# fail-closed guard, and none of them knows about the c8s-side artifacts
# (the RKE2 containerd-prep template). This sweep is the
# idempotent last word and runs on every uninstall, whatever the release's
# shape: leftovers may come from a previous install of a different shape,
# which this release's values cannot see.
#
# Baked node image exception: on the c8s node image the NRI plugin, its floor
# config, the containerd drop-in, and the managed RKE2 containerd template
# are baked into the measured image at the same paths the chart uses. They
# are node-image state, not release state — deleting them strips the node's
# fail-closed image admission until reimage — so the NRI and template steps
# below are skipped when the baked-only nri-node-ip.service unit exists.
#
# Fatal vs warn: containerd config removal and the runtime restart
# fail the sweep (the CLI then keeps the
# DaemonSet so its logs survive). Per-object netfilter failures warn and
# continue; a host with no iptables at all fails the sweep at the end, after
# every other step ran.
#
# Env (all required unless noted; set by `c8s uninstall` from the release's
# computed values):

#                            initContainer whose template/lock this sweep owns
